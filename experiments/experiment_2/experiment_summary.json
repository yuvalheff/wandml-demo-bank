The F1-optimal threshold of 0.235 increased recall from 47.1% to 74.7% while maintaining ROC-AUC at 0.932. This represents a 58% reduction in missed opportunities for identifying potential bank term deposit subscribers. The model now captures approximately 3 out of 4 potential subscribers compared to fewer than 1 out of 2 previously. While precision decreased to 54%, the business impact is significant: the model can now identify 74.7% of potential subscribers versus 47.1% in the previous iteration, dramatically improving marketing campaign effectiveness.",

By shifting from the default threshold of 0.5 to the F1-optimal threshold of 0.235, recall improved dramatically from 43.3% to 74.7% - exceeding the target of 70%. This represents a 58% reduction in missed opportunities. The threshold analysis reveals clear trade-offs: lower thresholds (0.2) achieve even higher recall (77.7%) but at greater precision cost, while the F1-optimal threshold provides the best balance.

At the F1-optimal threshold of 0.235, precision is 54.0% while recall reaches 74.7%. This means approximately 1 in 2 customers contacted will subscribe, compared to nearly 2 in 3 at the default threshold but with much lower recall. The precision-recall curve shows that achieving recalls above 75% requires accepting precisions below 50%. For the banking campaign context, this trade-off is favorable as the cost of missing a potential subscriber (false negative) typically exceeds the cost of contacting a non-subscriber (false positive).",

The model's probability distribution shows that most positive cases cluster in the 0.1-0.4 probability range, requiring the lower threshold for effective detection. The confusion matrix comparison across thresholds illustrates how lowering the threshold shifts the decision boundary to capture more positive cases at the expense of increased false positives. This inherent challenge suggests that future iterations should explore methods specifically designed for imbalanced datasets or consider cost-sensitive learning approaches.",
