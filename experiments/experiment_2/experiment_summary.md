# Experiment 2: Gradient Boosting with Threshold Optimization for Class Imbalance

## Experiment Overview

**Objective**: Address the main limitation from Experiment 1 by implementing precision-recall threshold optimization to improve positive class recall from 47.1% to target 70%+, while maintaining strong ROC-AUC performance.

**Primary Change**: Implement systematic threshold optimization through F1-optimal threshold selection using precision-recall curve analysis.

**Success Criteria**: 
- Primary: Achieve ≥70% recall for positive class while maintaining ROC-AUC ≥0.93
- Secondary: F1-score improvement to ≥0.65
- Business Impact: Enable identification of 70%+ of potential subscribers vs 47% in previous experiment

- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - Binary indicator V14_is_missing for missing values (-1.0)
  - Binary indicator V15_is_zero for zero values
- **Outlier Treatment**: Applied np.clip to V6 with bounds (-1000, 10000)
- **Total Features**: 18 (16 original + 2 engineered)

### Model Configuration
- **Algorithm**: GradientBoostingClassifier

  - learning_rate: 0.1
  - max_depth: 5
  - n_estimators: 200
  - subsample: 1.0
- **Validation**: 5-fold stratified cross-validation with ROC-AUC scoring

### Threshold Optimization
- **Method**: Precision-Recall curve analysis with F1-optimal threshold selection
- **Optimal Threshold**: 0.235 (maximizes F1-score)
- **Business Impact**: At optimal threshold, the model identifies 74.7% of potential subscribers

## Key Strengths

1. **Successful Class Imbalance Handling**: Achieved the target of 70%+ recall (74.7%) while maintaining ROC-AUC above 0.93
2. **Balanced Performance**: The F1-optimal threshold provides a good balance between precision (54.0%) and recall (74.7%)
3. **ROC-AUC Maintenance**: Successfully maintained discriminative power (0.932) from previous experiment
4. **Systematic Approach**: Comprehensive threshold analysis across multiple values provides flexibility for business decisions
5. **Model Calibration**: Good Brier score (0.063) indicates reliable probability estimates
6. **Production Ready**: Complete MLflow model pipeline with proper signatures and metadata

## Key Weaknesses

1. **Precision Trade-off**: Precision dropped to 54% at optimal threshold (from 65.2% at default), which may increase false positive costs
2. **Class Imbalance Persistence**: Despite optimization, the fundamental class imbalance (529 positive vs 3993 negative) remains challenging
3. **Limited Feature Engineering**: Only basic feature engineering implemented - potential for more sophisticated feature interactions
4. **Single Algorithm**: Gradient Boosting was maintained from previous experiment without exploring other algorithms that might handle imbalance better

## Business Impact Analysis

### Marketing Campaign Efficiency
- **Previous Performance**: 47.1% recall meant missing 52.9% of potential subscribers
- **Current Performance**: 74.7% recall means missing only 25.3% of potential subscribers
- **Improvement**: **58% reduction in missed opportunities**

### Cost-Benefit Trade-offs
- **False Positive Rate**: Increased from ~3% to ~8% due to lower threshold
- **Campaign Size Impact**: More customers will be contacted, increasing campaign costs but also potential revenue
- **Hit Rate**: Precision of 54% means roughly 1 in 2 contacted customers will subscribe

## Future Suggestions

1. **Cost-Sensitive Learning**: Implement algorithms that explicitly account for business costs of false positives vs false negatives
2. **Advanced Feature Engineering**: 
   - Create interaction terms between key predictors
   - Develop temporal features from campaign timing
   - Engineer customer segmentation features
3. **Alternative Algorithms**: Explore ensemble methods combining multiple algorithms, especially those designed for imbalanced datasets
4. **Calibration Improvement**: While current calibration is good, further improvement could enhance business decision-making
5. **Threshold Customization**: Develop business-rule based threshold selection allowing different thresholds for different customer segments

## Context for Next Iteration

The threshold optimization successfully achieved the primary objective of improving recall to 74.7% while maintaining ROC-AUC performance. The model is now significantly better at identifying potential subscribers, though at the cost of increased false positives. The next iteration should focus on either:

1. **Precision Recovery**: Finding ways to improve precision while maintaining the improved recall
2. **Advanced Modeling**: Exploring more sophisticated approaches to handle the class imbalance
3. **Business Optimization**: Developing segment-specific models or thresholds based on customer characteristics

The current model provides a solid foundation for deployment with configurable threshold settings based on business requirements.
