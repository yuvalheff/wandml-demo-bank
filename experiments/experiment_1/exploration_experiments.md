# Exploration Experiments Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the exploration experiments conducted to determine the optimal modeling approach for the bank marketing campaign prediction task.

## Experiments Conducted

### Experiment 1: Basic Preprocessing Validation
**Objective**: Test essential preprocessing steps identified from EDA
**Approach**:
- Handle special values in V14 (-1.0 indicates missing) and V15 (many zeros)
- Cap extreme outliers in V6 using 99th/1st percentile clipping
- One-hot encode categorical features (V2, V3, V4, V5, V7, V8, V9, V11, V16)

**Results**: 
- Created 44 features from original 16
- Preprocessing pipeline successfully handled data quality issues
- Ready for algorithm testing

### Experiment 2: Algorithm Comparison
**Objective**: Compare performance of different algorithms on preprocessed data
**Algorithms tested**:
- Logistic Regression (with standardization)
- Random Forest 
- Gradient Boosting

**Results**:
- Logistic Regression: 0.9078 ROC-AUC
- Random Forest: 0.9304 ROC-AUC ⭐
- Gradient Boosting: 0.9261 ROC-AUC

**Key Finding**: Random Forest performed best, indicating ensemble methods handle this dataset well.

### Experiment 3: Class Balancing Strategies
**Objective**: Address the significant class imbalance (88.3% vs 11.7%)
**Approaches tested**:
- SMOTE oversampling
- Class weights (balanced)
- Random Forest with class weights

**Results**:
- SMOTE: 0.9087 ROC-AUC
- Class weights (LogisticRegression): 0.9105 ROC-AUC
- Random Forest + Class weights: 0.9304 ROC-AUC ⭐

**Key Finding**: Class weights more effective than oversampling; Random Forest handles imbalance well.

### Experiment 4: Feature Engineering
**Objective**: Test domain-specific feature engineering based on EDA insights
**Features created**:
- V12 transformations (log, squared, binned) - most important feature
- Job success indicators (students, retired have highest rates)
- Age groups (young <30, senior >60)
- Campaign interaction features
- Previous campaign success indicator

**Results**:
- Feature Engineering + Class weights: 0.9109 ROC-AUC
- Minimal improvement (+0.0004) over basic preprocessing

**Key Finding**: Complex feature engineering not necessary; basic preprocessing sufficient.

### Experiment 5: Hyperparameter Optimization
**Objective**: Optimize best performing algorithms
**Results**:
- Random Forest (tuned): 0.9346 ROC-AUC
  - Best params: n_estimators=200, max_depth=None, min_samples_split=5, class_weight=balanced
- Gradient Boosting (tuned): 0.9355 ROC-AUC ⭐
  - Best params: n_estimators=200, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=5

## Final Conclusions

### Best Approach Identified:
- **Algorithm**: Gradient Boosting with hyperparameter tuning
- **Performance**: 0.9355 ROC-AUC
- **Key Preprocessing**: Outlier capping, categorical encoding, class balancing

### Key Insights:
1. **V12 remains the most important feature** (35.2% feature importance) - validates EDA findings
2. **Simple preprocessing outperforms complex feature engineering**
3. **Gradient Boosting handles class imbalance effectively** with proper hyperparameters
4. **No need for oversampling** - class weights sufficient
5. **Feature importance ranking**: V12 >> V6, V1, V10 >> campaign/demographic features

### Implementation Strategy:
Focus on robust preprocessing pipeline with Gradient Boosting as the primary algorithm, emphasizing hyperparameter tuning over complex feature engineering.
