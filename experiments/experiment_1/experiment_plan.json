Outlier treatment: Cap V6 feature using 99th and 1st percentile clipping (V6_q99 = df['V6'].quantile(0.99), V6_q01 = df['V6'].quantile(0.01), df['V6'] = np.clip(df['V6'], V6_q01, V6_q99))\n3. Categorical encoding: Apply one-hot encoding to all categorical columns ['V2', 'V3', 'V4', 'V5', 'V7', 'V8', 'V9', 'V11', 'V16'] using pd.get_dummies() with drop_first=True\n4. Column alignment: Ensure training and test sets have identical feature columns by taking intersection of columns after encoding\n5. No scaling required: Tree-based models handle mixed feature scales naturally",
  "experiment_feature_engineering_steps": "1. No complex feature engineering required based on exploration experiments\n2. Basic preprocessing provides sufficient feature representation\n3. Focus on preserving the strong predictive power of V12 (call duration/intensity) as identified in EDA\n4. Maintain categorical feature information through one-hot encoding\n5. Feature selection not needed - all 44 processed features contribute to model performance",

Cross-validation: Use 5-fold stratified CV to maintain class balance during hyperparameter tuning\n4. Baseline comparison: Include RandomForestClassifier with class_weight='balanced' as performance benchmark\n5. Final model selection based on highest mean CV ROC-AUC score with consideration for model complexity and overfitting",
